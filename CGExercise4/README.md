2. Implement functionality of reading and displaying image files in PPM format P6 and P3. Note
the error handling (eg. your program must support also damaged files) and the performance of
the reading algorithm (using buffers and big blocks rather than byte by byte). The user should
also be able to load and save JPEG files.
